## Introduction

A big welcome and thank you for considering contributing to Acom open source project! It's people like you that make it a reality for users in our community.

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue, email, or any other method with the owners of this repository before making a change. 

Reading and following these guidelines will help us make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved. It also communicates that you agree to respect the time of the developers managing and developing these open source projects. In return, we will reciprocate that  espect by addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

## Code of Conduct

We take our open source community seriously and hold ourselves and other contributors to high standards of communication. By participating and contributing to this project, you agree to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/acom-web/acom/blob/main/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Issues

Issues should be used to report problems with the framework, request a new feature, or to discuss potential changes before a pull request is created. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one. Adding a [reaction](https://github.blog/2016-03-10-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments/) can also help be indicating to our maintainers that a particular problem is affecting more than just the reporter.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests to our libraries are always welcome and can be a quick way to get your fix or improvement slated for the next release. In general, pull requests should:

- Only fix/add the functionality in question __OR__ address wide-spread whitespace/style issues, not both.
- Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
- Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
- Include documentation in the repo [here](https://github.com/acom-web/acom#readme).
- Be accompanied by a complete pull request template (loaded automatically when a pull request is created).

For changes that address core functionality or would require breaking changes (e.g. a major release), it's best to open an Issue to discuss your proposal first. This is not required but can save time creating and reviewing changes.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr)

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
2. Clone the project to your machine
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
4. Commit changes to the branch
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to this repo
6. Push changes to your fork
7. Open a pull request in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

## Coding Style

Use a consistent coding style. The following are the style convensions to be followed:

* 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Use a maximum of 120 characters per line
* You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification

## License

By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions will be understood to be under the same license that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.
